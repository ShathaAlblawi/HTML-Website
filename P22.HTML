      <h2 class="floted" style="color: #ce93d8;">Read about the planet Saturn</h2>
      <p class="floted">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. Despite its low density, Saturn is over 95 times more massive than Earth. The planet is famous for its beautiful rings, visible through a telescope. It takes approximately 29 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun and rotates on its axis in about 10 hours and 32 minutes.

      <h2 class="floted" style="color: #ce93d8;">Read about the planet Neptune</h2>
      <p class="floted">Neptune is the third-largest planet in the Solar System and the eighth planet from the Sun. Since Pluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet in 2006, Neptune holds the title of the farthest planet from the Sun. It has a mass approximately 17 times that of Earth, making it more massive than Uranus. Due to its great distance, Neptune cannot be seen with the naked eye and appears as a small, pale blue disk through a telescope. Its blue color is caused by methane gas, which absorbs red light from the Sun.
